ENTRIES = [{'id': 1, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 1', 'creation_date': 'Monday, 16 October, 2017, 2:44 pm', 'body': "Day one. Pretty straightforward, I'm a fan of today's assignments. It allows us some time to get accustomed to our new tool(s) if we decided to move on from Atom. I like how lightweight Sublime is, but it seems like one could get carried away with extra packages quickly. It's been awhile since I've written any Python, I'm really looking forward to getting back into it. Nick's description of the next few weeks wasn't completely foreign to me, hopefully I haven't forgotten everything I've already 'learned'."},
           {'id': 2, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 2', 'creation_date': 'Tuesday, 17 October, 2017, 10:36 pm', 'body': "Today was great. We got into some test driven development, I am not good at it at all. I have a hard time figuring out what I need to test. But getting full coverage and all passing tests is very rewarding, not to mention useful and a good practice, so I need to get better at it. I was familiar with today's paired programming assignment but it was completely different with the ping pong programming. I really like the work flow with that style of programming, I'm getting more out of it and I feel like both parties get the chance to be active participants during the whole process."},
           {'id': 3, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 3', 'creation_date': 'Thursday, 19 October, 2017, 7:17 pm', 'body': "Today was okay. I'm still waiting for the dead horse to show up, so far the workload has been manageable. I do have the luxury of being familiar with all the concepts and assignments that have been taught so far. It is motivating when I compare my old code with what I'm writing now. It's more pythonic and explicit, my testing and documentation have also vastly improved. I still have a long way to go but I'm remembering some of what I've forgotten. Big news for today is that dicts in 3.6 are ordered, pretty cool."},
           {'id': 4, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 4', 'creation_date': 'Friday, 20 October, 2017, 7:28 pm', 'body': "Today was cool. The mailroom project is taking longer than I anticipated, we are spending a lot of time using best practices and writing clean code from the start. But we are crushing it. We are crushers. I should spend more time planning out my modules. It's hard to see what all the pieces are until I'm pretty deep into the coding process. I cannot wait till py2 is unsupported, it had it's time to shine but like the coal industry it's only holding us back now. I understand the need to know both versions, nonetheless 2020 is going to be great. I have to be better about networking, I've been going to puppy meetups for close to two years and I've probably talked to 6 people. In the past I felt like I didn't know enough and would sound like an idiot, that is no longer an excuse."},
           {'id': 5, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 5', 'creation_date': 'Saturday, 21 October, 2017, 3:54 pm', 'body': "Day of Code. The code wars assignment was good, the repetition of writing the test scripts is really helping remember the syntax for @pytest.mark.parametrize. A few of us went over how to use setup.py and tox.ini for testing in both py2 and py3 it helped me get a better grasp on it. I wish Seattle had a Dunkin' Donuts."},
           {'id': 6, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 6', 'creation_date': 'Monday, 23 October, 2017, 10:42 pm', 'body': "Today was a hustle, two new projects with two new partners plus on old one from last week. Real logistical cluster-cuss. The sockets lab went okay, I need to figure out how to close open sockets outside of python, every time I got an error and my server crashed I had to change the port numbers. The data structure lab is rad, It's new territory for me and I'm learning a lot from it and that's why I'm here."},
           {'id': 7, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 7', 'creation_date': 'Tuesday, 24 October, 2017, 9:00 pm', 'body': "Today's code review was really helpful, seeing the linked list build from scratch helped me get a good understanding on it all. I'm digging the data structures a lot, working on them is changing the way I think about problems. I don't have to use pre-existing class or containers when I'm making something, I always have the option of making my own. Sockets have been a bit tougher, I'm having a hard time seeing what the end picture is supposed to be and it makes it tought for me to figure out what I need to do."},
           {'id': 8, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 8', 'creation_date': 'Wednesday, 25 October, 2017, 9:44 pm', 'body': "Lot's going on today. We did a white board challenge today it was a good exercise, but right as we started gaining momentum we got evicted and had to relocate. It was hard for me to get back on task, I need to work on that. My groups are farther along then I think, I have a hard time ending a day with work still on the board but it's now the standard."},
           {'id': 9, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 9', 'creation_date': 'Thursday, 26 October, 2017, 7:52 pm', 'body': "Another day, another data structure. Making progress on both the server and the structs. Really cool lightning talk about prime numbers today from Joseph. Much of it was over my head, but it really helped make the fuzzy ideas I had about them slightly clearer. Looking forward to tomorrow, my groups and I should be able to get pretty close to completion for the week."},
           {'id': 10, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 10', 'creation_date': 'Friday, 27 October, 2017, 5:40 pm', 'body': "Last day. Still a moderate amount of work to do. I'm really enjoying data structures, hopefully more are yet to come. Whiteboarding was frustrating, I need to start looking at the bigger picture and not try to solve it for a single use case. It was good experience regardless. A Pizza mart."},
           {'id': 11, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 11', 'creation_date': 'Monday, 30 October, 2017, 9:53 pm', 'body': "Good day. First of a new week, the pressure of last week is off of my shoulders and I have a good amount of clarity on what I need to focus on. The Pyramid framework is nice to work with even though I don't fully understand it yet. I appreciate my understanding of how to set up a server with sockets regardless of the frustration they caused me last week. I'm really starting to understand the data structures, as I do so the way I approach problems has been changing for the better."},
           {'id': 12, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 12', 'creation_date': 'Tuesday, 31 October, 2017, 7:44 pm', 'body': "Binary tree was tough to wrap my mind around, we spent well over an hour whiteboarding it before we even created the branch for it. It was a slow moving process but it was very productive. We attempted to tackle it a few different ways until we had a solid plan of attack. Finally got step1 deployed to Heroku, Carson came through big time on that one."},
           {'id': 13, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 13', 'creation_date': 'Wednesday, 1 November, 2017, 7:48 pm', 'body': "Today was a blur. I need to take some time after lecture to read all the notes from class so I can get a good understanding of what I need to do. It would also be good to have some time to think alone. The group work is good but I need to be able to understand the problem domain on my own before I can attempt it. I've been spending too much time working on a problem only to realize if I had taken the time to properly review the provided documentation I could have saved a lot of time and energy."},
           {'id': 14, 'title': 'Learning Journal Day 14', 'creation_date': 'Thursday, 2 November, 2017, 9:01 pm', 'body': "Today was okay. The lecture was a few days ahead of where I'm at, didn't get a chance to digest much of it. I think I am starting to understand binary thanks to Han's lightning talk. I went home at a reasonable time today and it's really cool."}
